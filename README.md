# CLUCK Backend

The backend is the brains of the CLUCK system. It is intended to have one instance running on a central server used by all timeclocks. This central server can be on-premises or hosted in the cloud.

For a step-by-step guide to configuring the server, see the [manual](Manual.md). For a description of the server's functions and technical information, see the [spec sheet](SpecSheet.md). For API docs, see the [OpenAPI/Swagger spec](swagger.yaml).
